## Addressing Concerns

A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing our concerns regarding the vagueness of the project topic. We expressed that the broad nature of the project aim was a challenge, potentially affecting our ability to deliver targeted and effective solutions.

## Company's Response

In response to our concerns, the company provided clearer guidance to help focus our efforts. They have **narrowed the project's aim** to specifically involve:

     - On Duty Driving
     - On Duty Not Driving
     - Off Duty Sleeping
     - Off Duty Not Sleeping

This more focused direction is expected to streamline our efforts, allowing us to apply our skills more effectively to deliver impactful results.
